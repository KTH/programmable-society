## Category

## Description

Our project idea is to create a chat forum, similar to Reddit, on blockchain. There have been many chat services developed on blockchain, but a forum with threads and topics is a newer, more unique concept. The project poses many technical questions; how to optimise retrieving and storing data, how to split data into threads, topics etc. We would use something like React for writing a front-end application. And we will probably target Ethereum as blockchain.

**Relevance**

This is an interesting use case for blockchain. Allowing for an anonymous, unmoderated platform for sharing thoughts and ideas. This also poses obvious ethical questions.
