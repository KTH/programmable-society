First, I would like to thank Pier for his fascinating essay. Reading his essay was enjoyable, and he gave outstanding insights/topics about his fascinating essay area of interest. Making me to think and read more about the ethics around this topic.

## Strengths

- Nice and clear case studies, very well explanatory and relevant to the topic. I appreciate that the author used three very well-known cases in the Crypto world because the reader can easily find information about these cases in addition to the essay.
- I liked the reflection part because it makes the writer and the reader think critically about the whole crypto technology and its' ethical aspects of it.


## Weaknesses / Improvement recommendation

In this section, I would like to give some points of improvement and **NOT** weaknesses. At the same time, someone other than me is the correct person for this job.

- The author does not use the "academic" way to write his references. It is not a big issue for me because I am an engineer. I enjoy reading different styles of essays and trying to understand the essay topic and not waste my time on its structure (Because I do not study soft science). However, I can not leave this comment out of my feedback because, for many scientists, the "good" reference structure is essential.
The author uses some acronyms that he needs to explain clearly what they stand for. 
- I enjoy one sentence explaining anonymity (because both technical and non-technical people usually confuse it with privacy).
- I would like to see some graphs showing some of the cases the authors present.
- See some screenshots or suggestions from well-known newspapers and articles that illustrate the topic of the essay. For example, **Forbes** has a fascinating article about this topic. That I suggest it is worth reading [Binance On Deathbed, And Crypto Is Birthed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/26/binance-dies-and-crypto-is-birthed/?sh=415da8e9502b)

## Some detailed points

### Introduction

As already explained the introduction sections is very well written and makes a very good introduction to the topic. It uses simple language and helps people that have no prior knowledge in this topic to understand and have a good introduction to the topic.

### Background

Author uses some acronyms about the USA government sections, that personal as reader I have no knowledge about them. So I needed to search about them. I would suggest just to give a reference from the USE government web page or other official web page with clear explanation about SEC, CFTC, IRS. Additionally the AML and KYC laws are well explained and give the reader a good first impression about them. I liked a lot that the author gives more examples from other countries apart the USA such as Canada or the UK. Finally again I would like to strongly mention that the author uses simple and clear language that I respect it a lot.

### Case studies

As I mentioned in previous sections I liked a lot that the author uses well known cases in her essay and with this way makes the readers experience much more interesting and engage, because the reader can easily find articles around the web about these topics. Also author explains very well the cases and it is important to mention that the author choosing three different topics to analyze gives to the reader more spherical knowledge and understanding about the topic. The only think that I would like to mention is that the author could add some graphs or give some valid papers. (As I have already explained).

### Reflection

Finally the reflection part is very well written. I would like to mention that the author points out very important and serious ethical issues, driving the reader to think and consider about the crypto technology. Personally I would like to suggest the author to improve this section talking more deeply about the ethical concerns that the crypto technology creates but also point out some other issues that it solves, so to make the reader think deeper about this very interesting and important topic.

## Overall

The structure of the essay is very nice and balance. Making the whole reading experience very enjoyable.

The language of the author is simple and without unnecessary "academic pseudo elitism", that I personally respect. Author uses language that everyone can understand. I am not neither book author neither literature student so to criticize the authors' language, or syntax. What I can say is that I enjoyed reading the essay and I easily understood all the points that author would like to point out.
