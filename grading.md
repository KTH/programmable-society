The course has project-based examination, where the student has to perform a number of tasks.

* To pass the course, the student has to complete and pass between 3 mandatory tasks:
  * presentation (mandatory)
  * demo (mandatory)
  * smart contract protocol development (mandatory)
* To get a grade better than E, the student can do optional tasks. The grading criteria below explain how to pass each task category.
  * essay
  * contribution to open-source
  * feedback
  * questions
* The same student cannot choose the same topic for two different tasks. 
* Important dates:
  * Deadline for presentations and demos: the day and time they are given in person
  * Deadline for essay / open-source: [Britney Spears birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears), 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline for feedback: 48 hours after go from original authors
  * Grand oral: [Brad Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt)'s birthday
  * Deadline for repeated tasks (all): **Jan 8 2024, 17h Stockholm time**.
  * The deadlines are strict and cannot be extended. Not meeting a deadline means failing the task / the repetition.

* Final grading scheme
  * A: 7 completed tasks
  * B: 6 completed tasks 
  * C: 5 completed tasks 
  * D: 4 completed tasks 
  * E: 3 completed tasks (excluding feedback)
* Group work is encouraged (max 2 persons) but you cannot be with the same person for more than 2 projects. You can work alone for one or at most two projects.
* A failed task requires to pass it again at the end of the course (repeat), based on the feedback from the failure. A task can only be repeated once.
* If the whole course is failed, no grades are kept if the student registers again to the course the year after. 
* After a proposal has been merged, the topic of that proposal cannot be changed.
* Group Rules
  * When you send a pull request for registration, please follow the name convention of using email addresses of two members to create the folder: email-email.
  * We recommend 2 students. Three is also possible for ambitious essays, demos or contribution to open-source.
