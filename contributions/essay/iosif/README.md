## Description
In this essay I will try to explore and unpack the idea and innovation behind the Internet Computing Protocol (ICP). ICP is a blockchain protocol which aims to extend the functionality of the public internet. That means not only data exchange but also decentralized computing. So ICP it's much more than an other typical block chain protocol, it is much more than that. As I see they are trying to create a decentralized internet where independent data centers all over the world will be able to combine their computing power to host software and internet services. In this point I would like to give kudos to Mojtaba and Javier (TAs) for their guidance to this topic and help.

## Relevance
Understanding the power and alternative usages of blockchain is one of the main core outcomes of the course, and ICP provides this prossibility because we can see an other perspective of a blockchain instead of classic examples (DEFI, NfTs). Also this topic combines knowledge from an other course that I took from KTH (DevOps and Distributed systems). Also it will help be to improve my critical thinking on multiple areas of computer science combining multiple field as I explained, because I want to write also my personal thoughts and reflections on this topic with my prior knowledge. Last but not least I would like to mention that my research will be mostly from ICP's web page using their white paper and documentation, I will try to find more recourses from paper pools such as IEEE explore for better conclusions and understanding.
I would like to share this information (Internet Protocol Web page)[https://internetcomputer.org/]
