## Deadline

- Task 1

## Category

- Smart Contract Protocol Development

## Description

Our project idea revolves around placing the grading system for this course, i.e., DD2485 Programmable Society, on block chain. The idea is to incorporate smart contracts, including tokens, where students taking the course get assigned Martin & Benoit tokens when passing different assignments of the course. These tokens can then get exchanged, e.g., for course certificate tokens.

**Relevance**

The aim of the project is to explore the field of smart contracts and to build something that will be useful for future course iterations. We believe that this will be a great learning experience for us, as well as an opportunity for students in future course iterations to learn and get inspired.
