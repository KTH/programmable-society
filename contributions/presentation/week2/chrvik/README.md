## Description

_Noir is a Rust-based DSL that enables zero knowledge implementations in smart contracts in a simple way. The goal of the presentation is to briefly describe how zero knowledge can be used in smart contracts, talk about the benefits of Noir for cryptographic beginners (such as myself) and showcase how Noir handles voting with zero knowledge proof contrasted with how Solidity handles voting and reflect on the differences and implications._

**Relevance**

_Implementing zero knowledge proof for smart contracts is complex. By reducing the complexity of these implementations with Noir, more developers could get motivated to get involved. Zero knowledge is a way to improve integrity as it adds a layer of privacy to make on-chain activity more discrete._
