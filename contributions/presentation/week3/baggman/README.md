## Description

Technology has propelled our world forward but our financial system lags behind, burdened by outdated processes that are slow, expensive and inefficient. The Centrifuge Protocol includes all the features needed to finance real world assets on a blockchain. The goal of this presentation is to make everyone understand how Centrifuge works, and why it can make finance accessible to all. It will also go into the Centrifuge chain which is the gateway for real-world assets to the Blockchain Multiverse. Centrifuge Chain is built on Substrate with an initial bridge to Ethereum.

**Relevance**

As the first protocol to bring real-world assets onchain, it seems relevant for this course. Understanding this technology will help us imagine a better financial system for the future.
