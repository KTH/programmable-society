## Description

This presentation will dive into how NFTs store their information like metadata and associated media like images or videos, from centralized servers to the decentralized world of IPFS. We'll start by looking at the limitations and risks of storing NFT data on traditional servers and on-chain, then, we'll look into to IPFS, showing how it's changing the game by making metadata storage more reliable and in tune with the decentralized ethos of blockchain.

**Relevance**
Chosing a storage method for your NFTs and their metadata is a design choice you will have to make when creating a new NFT contract. It is therefore highly relevant to know your options with their respective pros and cons.
