## Description

Reth is an execution layer for ethereum implemented in Rust.
The project is still in active development with a very open and friendly community.
I found a [good issue](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/issues/5906) that is very self-contained and seemed reasonable.
The pull request is already open here: [fix: randomly sample peers in `NetworkState::announce_new_block()` for block propagation](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/pull/5930)

**Relevance**

Reth implements a core component of the ethereum blockchain.
