## Description

In this demo we will see how we can set up a local blockchain with geth using a proof-of-authority consensus mechanism. We will for example create some accounts, write a genesis block, and connect a small network of nodes together that can send transactions.

**Relevance**

Setting up a local blockchain can be valuable for learning blockchain mechanisms such as processing transactions, consensus mechanisms, blockchain syncing and hard forks etc.
