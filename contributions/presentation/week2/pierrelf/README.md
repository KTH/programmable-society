## Description

My presentation will compare Fe and Solidity, two smart contract languages for the Ethereum blockchain. 
I'll begin with a short introduction to smart contracts and Ethereum before diving into:
- The rationale for using different languages in smart contract development.
- Key design and security features of Fe versus Solidity.
- Brief code comparisons to illustrate language differences.
 

**Relevance**

The choice between Fe and Solidity impacts the security, maintainability, and success of smart contracts. Understanding their differences helps in selecting the right tool for building robust and efficient applications on Ethereum.
