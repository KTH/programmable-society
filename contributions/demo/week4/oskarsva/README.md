## Title

* Showcasing Mythril: How to find vulnerabilites in your smart contract code?

## Names and KTH ID

* Oskar Svanstr√∂m (oskarsva@kth.se)

## Deadline

* Week 4

## Category

* Demo

## Description
I will demo the security analysis tool Mythril and show how it can be used to detect security vulnerabilities in your Solidity code. This will cover; installment, running and testing process on your local machine, reading the results and fixing found vulnerabilities. I will also briefly discuss alternatives to local tools, such as MythX, and compare pros and cons.

**Relevance**

Finding smart contract vulnerabilities is essential for ensuring the security and reliability. And also gain the auditors trust! I believe that this demo will be useful for all groups when developing the smart contract application.
