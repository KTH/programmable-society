## Description

I plan to present the Flint programming language.
First I would give a quick recap on blockchain and introduce the ethereum blockchain.
Next I would introduce the ideas behind Flint:
- Why a safer smart contract programming language is interesting
- The design principles of the language
- How it is safer
- Some code examples

**Relevance**

This is relevant to the topic of smart contracts because it is a programming language for smart contracts and it introduces some novel ideas to the space.
