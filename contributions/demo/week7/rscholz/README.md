## Description

E-voting is controversial, Germany ruled it out as unconstitutional whereas Estonia uses e-voting through the Internet since 2005. But e-voting can be used in other fields and the most important thing is integrity (votes can be either transparent or anonymous by purpose). How might it be combined with the field of smart contract. This demo aims to simulate an election/voting. (Depending on how easy the implementation or how broad the topic will be, some extra feature might be implemented. Feel free to comment or make any suggestion).
