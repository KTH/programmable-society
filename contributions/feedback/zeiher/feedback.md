# Feedback for Pierre

Thanks for the great essay Pierre. It was a very enjoyable read and it really helped me to gain some insight into the regulatory problems regarding crypto exchanges.

## Strengths

- The introduction into the topic was very clear, even for someone with no prior knowledge.
- The relevant case studies are well written and concise.
- I really enjoyed the reflection part, that encouraging a more grassroots approach to projects in the crypto space.

## Weakness

- I would have enjoyed a bit more technical details.
- The references are not following an academic style. Not really a problem for an essay, but it makes it hard to judge the quality of the references at a glance.

## Details

### Introduction & Background

These sections are - like the rest of the essay - really well written. Even as a reader who has no knowledge about crypto exchanges and legal issues. Right at the beginning some USA institutions, namely SEC, CFTC, IRS are mentioned. As I have little knowledge about the United States government institutions I would have needed an explanation about the mission of these organisations. I really liked the chapter on laws of AML and KYC. The purpose and reasoning behind these laws was clearly explained and it was easy to understand how DLT based companies could struggle to comply with these laws. However I find that a more technical introduction into the operation of crypto exchanges is missing from the essay.

### Case studies

The chosen case studies seem very relevant, even I had head of some of them in the news. They were very clearly described and presented in a concise manner highlighting the most important aspects. I liked that each use case emphasised different higher-level concepts. Personally though I would have appreciated more technical details, about the technologies these companies were using and why they failed to comply with regulations. Maybe also some insights if it would have even been possible to comply with regulations.

### Conclusion and Reflection

The conclusion nicely summarises the essay. I really appreciated the reflection part. I appreciate that the reflection states a clear and strong opinion and includes actionable recommendations.

### Overall

**Structure**

The essay is well structured and all parts have the right balance. The ordering of the chapters makes sense. Putting the Reflection after the Conclusion feels unconventional, but I think it was the right decision as the reflection departs quite drastically from the narrative and language of the rest of the essay.

**Language**

I could not find any language mistakes. (though I am probably the wrong person to ask)
Personally I think the language in the reflective part was a bit too nonchalant. The reflection looses a bit of credibility from the language, which is a shame since the opinions stated are very valid and agreeable.

**References**

The essay contains references from official government sources as well as mostly high quality news journals. The fact that only a list of links was provided made the references hard to judge at a glance. The essay could gain some credibility by citing some academic papers. Some useful additional academic material could have possibly been:
