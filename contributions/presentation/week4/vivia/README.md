## Description

The intrinsic determinism of blockchains is needed to achieve a consistent and verifiable record of transactions and data. As such, smart contracts lack randomness by design. Nonetheless, there are several applications for smart contracts in which randomness is needed, such as in lotteries or selecting validators for supporting a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain design. In this presentation, I aim to present different approaches to achieving randomness, ranging from less effective to more robust solutions. We will also discuss the security implications associated with each approach.

**Relevance**

In designing smart contracts security considerations are important. If not handled properly, randomness in our contract can serve as an attack vector.
