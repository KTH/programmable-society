## Title

_Showcasing Alchemy Notify API & NFT API_

## Names and KTH ID

Dina Lerjevik (lerjevik@kth.se)

## Deadline

- Week 6

## Category

- Demo

## Description

During this demo, I plan to showcase the Address Activity Webhook from the Alchemy Notify API, and how it can be used to notify you upon transfers to/from an address. More specifically, I will be monitoring my own wallet address and build a Discord Bot that notifies me upon NFT transfers to my wallet. Moreover, I plan to integrate this with the Alchemy NFT API in order to include information regarding the NFTs.

**Relevance**

Being used to instant confirmation upon purchasing something outside of blockchain, having to manually keep track of blockchain transactions can seem inconvenient [1]. I believe this demo will give a good first introduction to the Alchemy Notify API, which enables receiving real-time notifications for events, e.g., failed transactions or transfers to your wallet [2].
