We plan to create a dApp that allows users to access data about safety critical processes.
For example, information about food safety (lab results), construction safety and drug tests.
While this data exists now it is not easily accessible to the general public.
Additionally it makes safety critical processes transparent and allows for independent auditing.
Utilizing the blockchain as a public data strage layer unifies access to data.

As a team a aware that this proposal is still too broad to be actionable.
But we are actively exporing possible specific use cases for this general.
We plan to implement one specific use case.

**Relevance**

This topic is relevant because it leverage the blockchain technology to enable transparency, integraty and publicly accessible data.
