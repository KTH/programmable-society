## Description

As the Ethereum network has evolved, scalability issues have become eminent. One consequence of increased traffic on the Ethereum blockchain is higher gas prices and transaction congestion. Ethereum has adopted various approaches to alleviate these issues, including on-chain and off-chain approaches.

One notable off-chain scaling approach is layer-2 scaling, which involves outsourcing computation. Recently, Zero-Knowledge proofs have played an increasing role in Layer-2 scaling solutions by providing a method for verifying computations made off-chain. These proofs play a key role in verifying computations conducted off-chain, contributing significantly to the effectiveness of Layer-2 scaling solutions.

In this essay, I aim to explore zero-knowledge proofs for computation verification in the context of Ethereum scaling solutions. Different ZKP approaches, their implementations and a discussion of challenges and possibilities will be included.

**Relevance**

Scaling solutions are essential for a wider adoption of blockchain technology. By understanding blockchain scaling challenges and the mechanisms behind state-of-art solutions we can better understand the blockchain landscape, and possibly, in the future contribute to the development of this field.
