## Description

I plan to present the Fe programming language, witch is a new catting edge programming language for Ethereum. Fe language is a modern and innovative programming language. In the first part I will explain briefly what it **Ethereum** and what is **blockchain** (explaining what is a block and what is the chain). Then we will talk about Fe language and its dynamics.

* Briefly explanation about the language. (Theoretical)
* Explain that the language is used to build Ethereum VMs (Personal favor ðŸ˜„)
* Presenting couple showcases of the language.
* Finally we will explain a simple code on how we can make a block and add it to the chain of the Ethereum. (Don't know if it will work properly)

**Relevance**
This topic is very relevance for the next week because I will present a programming language for blockchain and Ethereum witch is in the edge of technology (sins 2021). It one of the most innovative languages for this purpose with a very active GitHub community, with that I want to say that it is not only relevance for the next week but also with the whole idea of the course (open source) using GitHub.
