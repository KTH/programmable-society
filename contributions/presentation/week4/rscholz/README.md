## Description

The process of digitilisation has also forced criminals to become digitilised (counterfeiting â†’ credit card fraud e.g.). So how do we ensure security on smart contracts? I will present the consequences if there is a lack of security. As a possible solution I will give an insight to MultiSig and MPC wallets.

**Relevance**

It is of high relevance to ensure security on smart contracts, because without security smart contracts would be useless.
