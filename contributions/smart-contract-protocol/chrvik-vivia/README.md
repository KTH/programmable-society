The primary objective of this project is to foster a culture of increased salary transparency. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to create a secure and immutable system for recording anonymized financial details related to employee salaries. This initiative seeks to empower employees, address disparities, and ultimately contribute to a fair and transparent salary system. This system will serve as a transparent ledger accessible to all relevant parties within the organization. Through this technology, employees will have the ability to confidently validate the correctness of their compensation and gain insights into the salaries of their peers without compromising individual privacy.

**Relevance**

In many organizations, the culture of secrecy around salaries prevails, hindering employees from validating the fairness of their compensation and creating an atmosphere of distrust. The common practice of discouraging employees from discussing their salaries exacerbates this issue. To address these challenges, we propose a solution that not only ensures employees have access to their own salary details but also facilitates a broader understanding of compensation structures within the company.
