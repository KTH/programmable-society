The course has a project-based examination, where the student has to perform a number of tasks.

* To pass the course, the student has to complete and pass between 3 mandatory tasks:
  * presentation (mandatory)
  * demo (mandatory)
  * smart contract protocol development (mandatory)
* To get a grade better than E, the student can do optional tasks in the following categories
  * essay (optional)
  * contribution to open-source (optional)
  * feedback (optional)
  * questions (optional)
* Final grading scheme
  * A: 7 completed tasks
  * B: 6 completed tasks 
  * C: 5 completed tasks 
  * D: 4 completed tasks 
  * E: 3 completed tasks (excluding feedback)
* The same student cannot choose the same topic for two different tasks. 
* Important dates:
  * Deadline for presentations and demos: the day and time they are given in person
  * Deadline for essay: [Britney Spears birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears), Dec 2 2023, 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline for feedback: 48 hours after submission from the original authors
  * Grand oral: [Brad Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt)'s birthday, Dec 18 2023
  * Deadline for open-source: [David Bowie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie)'s birthday, Jan 8 2024, 17h Stockholm time (if repeated Jan 15 2024)
  * Deadline for repeated tasks (all): **Jan 8 2024, 17h Stockholm time**.
  * The deadlines are strict and cannot be extended. Not meeting a deadline means failing the task / the repetition.
* Group work is encouraged for smart contract development (max 2 persons).
* A failed task requires to pass it again at the end of the course (repeat), based on the feedback from the failure. A task can only be repeated once.
* If the whole course is failed, no grades are kept if the student registers again to the course later on. 
* After a proposal has been merged, the topic of that proposal cannot be changed.
* When you send a pull request for registration, please follow the name convention of using email addresses to create the folder: `kthlogin` or `kthlogin-kthlogin` for group registration.
