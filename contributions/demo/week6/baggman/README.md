## Title

* Blockchain monitoring, incident response with Open zeppelin defender

## Names and KTH ID

* Edvin Baggman (Baggman)
    
## Deadline

* Week 6

## Category

* Demo

## Description

OpenZeppelin Defender is known for security monitoring and general automation. This demo will use several of the components from OpenZeppelin Defender to automate incident response for a smart contract. 

The plan is to:â€¨ 
 - Deploy a pausable contract
 - Create an autotask on OpenZeppelin defender that can pause the contract
 - Create Sentinel that will invoke the autotask. This will watch for conditions that you set up.
 - Do something with the contract that the Sentinel will detect

**Relevance**

Security is a very important aspect of smart contracts, and therefore we need tools for monitoring, analytics and response. This demo will show how one could safeguard contracts, which is crucial in developing blockchain applications.
