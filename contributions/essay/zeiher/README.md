# Description

International Border Crossings remain a daunting procedure for many even in the "globalized" world we live in today.
Outside of supranational organisation (e.g. European Union) we rely on VISAs to regulate entry, exit and duration of stay in a foraign country.
Often additional information like work-permits and state social welfare benefits are only granted to holders of specific VISAs.
Since the system today is pretty much entirly paper based this system comes with major risks and inefficiencies.

All international travelers share stories of endless cueing at immigration to receive a simple stamp in their passports.
In many lower-income countries the need to bribe immigration officiers in cash in order to not be denied entry is common.
Once inside the foreign country loosing once passport can be very painful, as usually only the embassy of ones home country can reissue a passport and often this process takes weeks to complete.
Connected with the loss of once passport is a major risk for identity theft and forgery of passports.

Blockchain technology is especially interesting for replacing tradiditional passports and VISAs as it can fully replace all existing functions of Passports and VISAs as well as significantly improve the security for states and passport holders alike.
Being forgery proof is one of blockchains stand-out features which helps states in their border control efforts and mitigates risks of identity theft.
For passport holders having a digital document greatly simplifies reissuance, which could be as simple as authenticating oneself on the blockchain.
Of course, moving to a digital solution also opens up new security vulnerabilities like hacking or lack of access to digital infrastructure.

In the essay I plan to explore the following:
- Current Passport and VISA limitations
- Digital Identities on Blockchain as the underlying foundation
- A possible implementation
- Risks and other Considerations that emerge with digital passports (e.g. privacy)

**Relevance**

Digital Passports can be seen as a form of Digital Identity on the Blockchain.
Blockchain are a very interesting technology to create digital passports for two reasons.
The distributed de-centralized nature of blockchain is crutial for digital passports as states would never accept a digital passport technology that was centrally managed in a single state (e.g. by a large company in the USA or China).
The security and defence against attacks are very important because digital passports store incredibly important information.
There already is a digital passport implementation called [Known Traveller Digital Identity](https://ktdi.org) that can be used for travels between the Netherlands and Canada.
