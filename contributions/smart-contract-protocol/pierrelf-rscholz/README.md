## Deadline

- Task 1

## Category

- Smart Contract Protocol Development

## Description

This project aims to explore event ticketing using blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and efficient ticketing system. The primary objective is to address common issues in the current event ticketing industry, such as ticket fraud, scalping, and lack of a secondary market. By developing a smart contract-based ticketing protocol, this could enable event organizers to issue digital tickets directly on the blockchain, ensuring the ticket uniqueness and traceability. Attendees will purchase and store their tickets in digital wallets, facilitating easy transfer and resale within a controlled environment set by the organizer.

**Relevance**

The event ticketing market is plagued with issues like scalping, leading to inflated prices, and a market dominance by a few opaque players. These issues often result in a poor experience for both event organizers and attendees. As made apparent by the recent Ticketmaster/Taylor swift controversies, buyers are tired of the current monopoly. There seems to be some players in the space already but a open source proof of concept can be good for anyone learning about the space.
