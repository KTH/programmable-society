## Description

I plan to present and run in-front of the class an fully handmade contract, using Foundry **tool chain**. I will present a fully automated bash script with a lot of the tools that Foundry comes with. The Foundry is a fairly new block chain tool apart of the Hardhat witch is currently the mort popular tool. The Foundry's initial release was back to Jan 15, 2022 (1.0.0), now it is in (1.0.10).

* Briefly Foundry presentation (one slide)
* Brief contract explanation (Just for understanding)
* Start the Foundry magic.
    * Show some commands that Foundry come with. (Comes with more tools than other similar tools. 🧐 Hardhat)
    * Run the commands using the automated script.
    * Explain all the commands in the script.
    * Explain what we take to our cmd from the Foundry tools

**Relevance**
This topic is relevant for the weeks topic not only because the Foundry is new and have a very active community with a very robust online tutorial like book, but also includes more tools than other similar tools that are using in production these days. So long story short with Foundry we take a new and fresh tool chain that is more complete and robust tool for testing. Also in my demo we gonna see how to use scripting for our blockchain pipeline, (classmates will gonna get help for their future in the course assignments and industry).
