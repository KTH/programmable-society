# Feedback for Fabian Zeiher
## Digital Passport - Better Security and Privacy with Blockchain Technology

Thanks for the great essay Fabian! It was a great read and very approachable, I'd love to see this tech in use. Here is some feedback according to the criteria.

### High level
#### Strengths
- The essay is well written and easy to read, I think the topic is super interesting and the explanation of zero knowledge proofs are very approachable for being a complex topic.
- I appreciate the critical viewpoint towards these implementationslike KTDI. It seems many of the solutions use crypto and blockchain as buzzwords while still intending to keep everything centralized.
    - For example Worldcoin on the surface seems to be a decentralized platform, but it appears they are the only ones providing the identity verification service, effectively making them a centralized authority. The orb hardware and many other services being open source does show a step in the right direction though.
- The sources seem recent and relevant, most of them being proper research papers.
- The reflection and conclusion provide a good summary and critical analysis of the topic.


#### Weaknesses
- The language in the essay seems to have many small mistakes that could have been caught with a simple spell checker. While the content is not directly affected, it does make the essay feel less professional.
- While this may not be possible due to the length limit, I would love some more in depth explanations of the different solutions, and how they would compare from a user's perspective. 
- The essay is very focused on the technical aspects of the solutions, while it does mention the user's perspective a few times, I would love to see a discussion about how this tech can be rolled out in a way that's inclusive to all, for example those which may not have access to a smartphone.


### Details
#### Structure
In my opinion, the essay is well divided into clear sections. The introduction is quite long but feels very fit for the topic as there is a lot to introduce. The sections are well divided into clear topics which build upon the previous ones. The conclusion and reflection provide a good summary and great critical analysis of the topic.

#### Substance
The essay is very well researched and the sources seem relevant and recent. The language is easy to read and explains complex topics in a way that is approachable. As mentioned above, I would love to see a more in depth discussion about the different solutions and how they compare from a user's perspective, as well as how this tech can be rolled out in a way that's inclusive to all. Overall however I think it's a great introduction to the field of zero knowledge proofs and how they can be implemented as a digital passport.

### Small errors
- "This is facilitated once again by Private Key Cryptography" is the first time private keys are mentioned
- ‚ÄùZero-**Kow**ledge Proof" typo in section 3 
- "a traveller could **proof** to be more than 18 years old" probably should be **prove**?
- Inconsistent casing of Worldcoin or WorldCoin
