## Description

SmartPy simplifies smart contract development by leveraging Python, making the transition to blockchain more approachable. Beyond its familiar syntax, SmartPy compiles to Michelson which ensures that contracts are verifiable and secure on the Tezos platform. If you want a smooth transition into writing smart contracts, why not start with SmartPy?

**Relevance**

Quite obvious since SmartPy is a DSL for the Tezos platform.
